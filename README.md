# Weather App

## Description

The Weather App is a demonstration of my skills, designed to showcase my proficiency in web development. This application is built using Next.js, React, and React-Redux, leveraging the power of these technologies to provide weather information. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/), managing and distributing the data seamlessly through Redux for efficient rendering within React components on pages served by Next.js. The Weather App combines functionality with an aesthetically pleasing, responsive design.
